# Maryland

As of August 2023, the Maryland State Board of Elections offers custom URLs to organizations
who would like to track voters that register to vote via Maryland's online system. 
The Maryland State Board of Elections' IT Department will create a custom URL,
allowing you to track an applicant who registers to vote by using your custom URL.

## Process

1. Request a custom URL by emailing info.sbe@maryland.gov or melissia.dorsey1@maryland.gov (valid as of Oct 2023) with your organization's name.
2. Maryland's Department of Elections IT Department will create a custom URL.
3. Once the URL is ready, you can then track voter registrations completed via your custom URL.

## Gathering the Data

1. The data provided is the number of voters that used the custom link and the number that actually went through the form and submitted an application.
2. The data will be available via a file that is emailed daily or weekly depending on your preference.
