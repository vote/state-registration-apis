# Washington

Washinton can issue you a organization ID. You can then send voter
to the state website, passing this organization ID as a URL parameter.

You can find aggregate statistics on how many voter are registering
using your organization ID on [this page](https://voter.votewa.gov/reports/voterdrivestats.aspx).

## Process

1. Email elections@sos.wa.gov and say that you would like a unique URL on votewa.gov. You may need to provide some information about your organization. It can take a week or longer to hear back and you may need to send a follow-up email if you don't hear back.
2. The elections office will set up your organization ID and send you the URL to use.
3. You can start sending voters to that URL, and check your aggregate statistics on [this page](https://voter.votewa.gov/reports/voterdrivestats.aspx).
