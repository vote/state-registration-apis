The Virginia Department of Elections offers custom URLs to organizations
who would like to track voters who register to vote via Virginia's online system. 
The Department of Elections' IT Department will create a custom URL,
allowing you to track an applicant who registers to vote by using your custom URL.

## Process

1. Email victoria.mainwaring@elections.virginia.gov with your organization's name, email, phone number, and the name you would like used in the URL.
2. Virginia's Department of Elections IT Department will create a custom URL.
3. Once the URL is ready, you can then track voter registrations completed via your custom URL.
